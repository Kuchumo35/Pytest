Explanation
To start, the code imports the required libraries, which include Math for mathematical operations, Random for producing random numbers, and Pygame for the game logic.
After initializing Pygame, 800X600 game window is made. The title of the game is ‘One Piece’.
All of the game’s assets are loaded, including the player, background, meat, and shoot images.
A list of meat item is generated with random starting positions, and the player’s initial position is fixed.
The text “game over” and the score are displayed. In the upper left corner of the screen, the score is shown, and if the player is unable to hit the meat, the game over text appears before the screen.
The player function is defined to draw the player image on the screen at the player's current position.
The meat function is defined to draw each meat object on the screen at its current position.
 The shoot function is defined to draw the shoot image on the screen at the shoot's current position.
 The collision function is defined to check if the shoot has collided with any meat. It uses the Euclidean distance formula to calculate the distance between the shoot and the meat.
 The main game loop begins. In each iteration of the loop, the screen is filled with black color, and the background image is drawn on the screen.
The game checks for any keyboard events, and if the player presses the left or right key, the player moves in the corresponding direction. If the player presses the space key, the shoot is fired. The player's position is updated, and the meat objects move down the screen. If a meat object reaches the bottom of the screen, the game is over. 
The game checks for collisions between the shoot and the meat objects, and if a collision is detected, the shoot is reset, and the score is incremented. The meat object that collided with the shoot is reset to a random position at the top of the screen. The meat and player objects are drawn on the screen, and the score is displayed. 
The screen is updated to reflect these changes.
The game continues to run until the player closes the game window.
